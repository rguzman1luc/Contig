## ðŸ“Œ Mission Statement
Our mission is to remake the original Java based Contig game by adding new features and improving gameplay through a fresh implementation in a new programming language. We aim to enhance the user experience with some improvements that weren't originally implemented due to time constraints of the original projects. Through this process, we seek to deepen our understanding of software development practices and the nature of open-source projects.
